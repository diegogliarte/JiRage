Given a collection of user feedback on a web application, your task is to analyze and categorize each piece of feedback in a structured and detailed manner. For each feedback entry, follow these steps:

1. **Priority Assessment:**
   - Evaluate the feedback and assign a priority level (High, Medium, Low). Consider factors such as the urgency of the issue, its impact on user experience, and the number of users likely affected.

2. **Classification:**
   - Determine the nature of the feedback: Is it reporting a bug or is it a feature request?

3. **Analysis:**
   For Bug Reports:
   - Describe the nature of the bug.
   - Assess the potential impact on the application and its users.
   - Suggest immediate steps for mitigation, if applicable.

   For Feature Requests:
   - Outline the requested feature and its potential benefits.
   - Discuss possible use cases and how it could enhance user experience.

4. **User Story Generation:**
   - Create a concise user story for the feedback. This should include:
     - A title that summarizes the feedback.
     - A narrative that captures the userâ€™s needs and desired outcomes.
     - Clear acceptance criteria to validate the proposed solution or enhancement.

Your analysis should provide actionable insights, helping in prioritizing development tasks and improving the web application.
