The page crashes every time I try to submit my form. It happens on both mobile and desktop versions
I would love to have a dark mode feature in the application. It's easier on the eyes during night-time browsing
The search function is very slow, taking more than 30 seconds to return results, which is frustrating
There is no way to export the data I input into the app. An export to CSV feature would be incredibly helpful
I noticed that the images on the product pages are not loading properly in the Safari browser
Adding multi-language support would greatly enhance the app's accessibility for non-English speakers
I'm getting an error message when I try to reset my password, but the message doesn't specify what's wrong
It would be great if the application could remember my preferences and settings across devices
The user interface for the settings section is confusing and not intuitive, making it hard to navigate
I've noticed some typos and grammatical errors in the help section, which might be misleading for new users
